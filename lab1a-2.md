# Reflection Questions
•	- Which file editors are best for remote access and why?

ANS: NANO as it is the easiest terminal editor to start with for quick edits on remote servers, excellent for beginners or very simple tasks. 

•	- Compare software installation methods: SaaS vs binaries vs repos vs source.

ANS:SaaS does not require installation as is hosted remotely on the provider's servers and accessed over the internet via a web browser or API.
    Binaries are pre-compiled machine code files are downloaded and executed directly on the user's system.
    Repositories are software that are managed by a package manager that automatically downloads, installs, and updates pre-compiled software packages and their dependencies from a central server.
    Source Code is human-readable source code which is downloaded and compiled into a binary executable locally on the user's machine.

•	- What are pros/cons of each method from user and developer perspectives?

ANS:SaaS Pros No installation required; automatic updates; accessible from any device Cons Requires constant internet access; less control over features; data security and privacy concerns
    Binaries Pros Relatively easy to install; no compilation needed; works offline; faster installation than source Cons Platform-specific (e.g., Windows .exe vs. macOS .dmg); potential compatibility issues; manual updates usually required
    Repositories Pros Automatic dependency management; easy updates; reliable and tested packages Cons Limited to software available in the repo; not always the latest version; less control over configuration
    Source Code Pros Maximum control over configuration and optimization; access to the very latest features; highly transparent Cons Most complex method; requires developer tools (compilers); time-consuming; difficult dependency management
    
•	- How did using CLI improve your understanding of Linux?

ANS: It lets me interact directly with the core system components, rather than relying on the abstractions of a graphical user interface, this helps me build a deeper understanding towards linux.
