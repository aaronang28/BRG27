#Reflection Questions
1.	What challenges did you encounter during the virtual machine setup?
   
   ANS: The installation took a long time as it is sharing resources with my actual pc
   And although I had used VMware before it was a few years ago, so I had to remember how to use it and get myself familiarized with it again.

2.	What did you learn about virtualisation tools and their differences?
   
    ANS: Virtualization tools are clones of an actual pc created in an isolated virtual environment and there are 2 different types of VMs, type1 creates a layer directly above the hardware and type 2 is created on top of the host operating system.

3. How confident do you feel using Ubuntu after completing this lab?

    ANS: After completing this lab, I felt slightly more confident using Ubuntu as this lab helped me refresh my memories of using it in the past and I believe practice makes perfect.

4. In what ways can a virtualised Linux environment help in industry scenarios?

   ANS: A virtual machine is flexible, isolated, cost efficient, has awesome scalability and lastly it enables automation. Helping companies save money and time.

5. What would you do differently if setting up another VM?

   ANS: I would add more features to it and play around with it more, so that I can explore more things and features, also learning more things in the process. I would also do snapshots so that I can easily recover my VM when making massive changes or if anything goes wrong.
