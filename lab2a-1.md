# 2a-1 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis
# Lab Instructions
•	- Choose two printers to compare (e.g., budget inkjet vs office laser).
•	- List all potential costs (fixed and variable). Examples: printer, cartridges, paper, power, service.
•	- Define your assumptions: time period (5 years), weekly usage (750 pages), power on (40 hrs/week).
•	- Use online sources (e.g., Officeworks, eBay, OEM manuals) to gather pricing and specs.
•	- Calculate total quantity of consumables required for each printer over the chosen period.
•	- Create or use a spreadsheet to total all costs (use formulas).
•	- Compare final TCO values and reflect on the results.
# Spreadsheet Components (Columns to Include)
•	- Item Description
•	- Type (Fixed/Variable)
•	- Unit Price
•	- Units Consumed (based on assumptions)
•	- Total Cost (Unit Price × Units Consumed)
# Example Assumptions to Use
•	- Comparison period: 5 years
•	- Pages printed per week: 750
•	- Power usage per week: 40 hours
•	- Cost of electricity per kWh: check local provider (e.g., $0.30)
•	- Cost of paper (ream of 500): e.g., $6
•	- Ink yield per cartridge: refer to specs (e.g., 500 pages)

# Reflection Questions
•	- Based on the TCO, which printer is the most cost-effective over 5 years?

    ANS:The laser printer, due to significantly lower consumable (toner) cost per page.
    
•	- Would the answer change for a home user who prints only 5 pages per week?

    ANS:Yes. For very low usage, the inkjet becomes cheaper, as the higher upfront laser cost would not be justified.
    
•	- What other non-financial factors could influence printer selection?

    ANS:Print quality, Speed, Noise, Size and portability
    
•	- What cost components are more significant for a large workgroup printer?

    ANS: INK, Power consumption and Maintenance and servicing
    
•	- At what point (in years/pages) do the two printer options break even in cost?

    ANS:The laser printer breaks even at approximately 2–3 years or ~70,000–80,000 pages, after which it becomes cheaper overall.
